# Big Switch Case

A case written in OpenSCAD to be used with a [Kailh Big Switch](https://novelkeys.com/products/the-big-switch-series) and the PCB sold by [keeb.io](https://keeb.io/products/big-switch-pcb).

The USB cut out is for USB-C, so this is compatible with an [Elite-C](https://keeb.io/products/elite-c-low-profile-version-usb-c-pro-micro-replacement-atmega32u4). The cut out is fairly large so it may work with a regular Pro Micro.
